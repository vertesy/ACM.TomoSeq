### Analysis scripts for the Lacraz et al. manuscript: "Spatial transcriptomics unveils ZBTB11 as a master regulator of fibrofatty replacement in ACM".


The aim of this repository is to provide an insight, and be a transparent about the analyses, as well as to help readers build similar pipelines.

Therefore, the scripts are provided as a resource, not as an executable pipeline. The authors apologize to the reader, but cannot provide support on troubleshooting if the reader tries to run (parts of) the pipeline on his or her own machine.

We will try to answer conceptual questions, for that please use the issues tab, rather than sending private emails.

Thank you for reading.
